# Angular Testing Workshop Demo Project

This small angular project supports my development workshops on angular testing using jest for unit- and integration testing and cypress for component and end-to-end testing.

Please feel free to notify me on inconsistencies or send me a pull-request.

## Development server

Run `npm run start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.


## Running tests

- Run `npm run jest` to execute the unit and integration tests via jest.
- Run `npm run jest-watch` to execute the unit and integration tests via jest in watcher mode.
- Run `npm run cypress-component` to execute cypress component tests
- Run `npm run cypress-e2e` to execute cypress end-to-end tests
- Run `npm run cypress-open` to open the cypress application
